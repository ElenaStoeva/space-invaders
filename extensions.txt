Hi,

Below is a brief description of the extensions that I included:

1. I added a _score attribute in wave.py, which keeps track of the player's score.
The current score is displayed during the whole game. Eeach alien is worth 10*(index of alien's row + 1) points.

2. I also added different sounds for the moments when the ship and the aliens fire a bolt, and when the ship or an alien is destroyed.
There is an active message during the active state of the game which says that the player can turn the sound on/off by pressing 's'.
However, when I play the game on my computer, there is a slight sound delay (around 1 sec). I'm not sure why this is the
case as I made sure that I run the sounds right after a bolt is fired/the ship or the alien is destroyed.

3. Every time an alien is killed, the rest of the aliens speed up.

4. I added an attribute in app.py which keeps track of the highest score that the player has achieved so far. If the player sets a new record,
a congratulation message appears after the game end. The Personal Best score is displayed while the user is playing (STATE_ACTIVE and STATE_PAUSED).

5. There is an attribute _lives in app.py which keeps track of the player's remaining lives. A message which says how many lives left
is displayed while the user is playing (STATE_ACTIVE and STATE_PAUSED).

6. After the game finishes, the user is given an option to play again by pressing 's'.

7. I used the Arcade font style and added a black background (a GRectangle object).

After I added all these extensions, I noticed that the bolts are moving more slowly (maybe because the whole game became slower) 
so I changed the constant BOLT_SPEED from 10 to 15. Now the bolts are moving reasonably quickly.
