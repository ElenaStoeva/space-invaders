# Space Invaders Game

My final project for CS 1110: Introduction to Computing using Python - a game based on the classic arcade game Space Invaders.

To run the game, execute the command `python space-invaders` just outside the `space-invaders` repository folder or run `python __main__.py` inside the repository directory.
